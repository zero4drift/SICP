;; I think it is as efficient as the one of exercise 4.35
;; cause the predication and computation of k
;; is theoretically a iteration of k

;; though (require (>= hsq ksq)) and (require (integer? k)) may filter some values of k
;; considered from bigger scale, the conputation work will not be significantly reduced
