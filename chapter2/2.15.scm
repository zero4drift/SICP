;; in short: uncertainty accumulated;

;; execise 2.14 proves that operations,
;; such as add/sub/mul/div of intervals enlarge the range of the result interval,
;; which makes the result less precise,
;; manily due to the inherent uncertainty of interval itself;
;; the equation with less intervals computes more precise result
